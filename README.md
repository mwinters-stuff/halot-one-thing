# halot-one-thing
Program to make the halot-one range of creality 3d printers more openly accessable.


Work based on (creality-remote-control) [https://github.com/danielkucera/creality-remote-control/]

Also working on wiresharking the websocket protocol to find more features.

This should be small and trim enough to run on the printer

# Plans
Include and not limited to.
* MQTT reporting of printer status
* InfluxDB reporting of printer status
* OpenAPI rest interface to get status, and set print options, upload files and start/stop/pause printing e.t.c.
* Web interface, showing print status, camera view, setting of print options and anything else I can find.

# Other stuff

See (here)[https://www.winters.nz/halot-one/logging-in/] to see how to login to your halot-one.
See future document - on how to install syncthing on your halot-one to upload files to printer eaisly.
